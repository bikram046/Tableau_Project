# Tableau_Project
This project focuses on analyzing HR data, particularly examining employee attrition and job satisfaction across various attributes such as department, age group, gender, education field, and job role. By utilizing a Tableau dashboard, we aim to gain insights into factors influencing attrition and satisfaction, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and overall job satisfaction.
